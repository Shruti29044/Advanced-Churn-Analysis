# README for Customer Churn Analyzer (Python Project)

---

## üìù Project Overview

**Customer Churn Analyzer** is a highly advanced Python-based business intelligence tool that allows Business Analysts and Data Scientists to:

- Upload customer data.
- Build highly sophisticated churn prediction models.
- Analyze customer segments and behavior.
- Simulate retention campaign effects.
- Estimate financial impact of churn reduction.
- Export simulation results and reports.
- Visualize churn insights with interactive dashboards.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python 3.7+
- Streamlit (interactive web interface)
- scikit-learn (machine learning)
- XGBoost (advanced gradient boosting)
- pandas, numpy (data processing)
- matplotlib, seaborn, plotly (visualization)
- SHAP (model interpretability)

---

## üìÇ Project Structure

```
ChurnAnalyzer_Advanced.py      # Main Python app
sample_customer_data.csv       # Sample dataset for testing
```

---

## üîß Prerequisites

- Install Python 3.7 or higher.
- Verify installation:

```bash
python --version
```

- Install required packages:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost matplotlib seaborn streamlit plotly shap
```

## üöÄ How to Run

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Extract the ZIP

Unzip `ChurnAnalyzer_ProfessionalAdvanced.zip` and navigate into the folder.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Run the analyzer:

```bash
streamlit run ChurnAnalyzer_Advanced.py
```

‚úÖ Streamlit will launch the app in your default web browser.

## üìÑ Sample Dataset

A file `sample_customer_data.csv` is provided for testing.

| CustomerID | Tenure | Purchases | Engagement | Churn |
|------------|--------|-----------|------------|-------|
| 1001 | 24 | 10 | 85 | 0 |
| 1002 | 36 | 15 | 90 | 0 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

- **Churn column is mandatory (1 = churned, 0 = retained).**
- You can replace with your own customer dataset following this format.

## üî¨ Advanced Analyzer Features

- Upload your dataset.
- Automatic feature selection for numeric columns.
- Supports multiple ML models:
  - Logistic Regression (baseline)
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
- Full model comparison & evaluation:
  - AUC (Area Under Curve)
  - Precision, Recall, F1-Score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - ROC Curve visualization
- SHAP Explainability:
  - Global feature importance
  - Local prediction explanations
- Simulate retention campaigns with adjustable uplift effects.
- Calculate projected churn rate after retention actions.
- Segment-level analysis (high-value customers, tenure groups, engagement levels).
- Full interactive visualizations:
  - Churn distribution
  - Feature impact
  - Segmented churn risk
  - Interactive ROC curve
- Export adjusted predictions and full reports as CSV.

## ‚ö† Challenges and Limitations

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preparation Complexity
- Requires clean, structured datasets.
- No built-in advanced feature engineering or categorical encoding.
- Requires domain knowledge to select relevant features.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Advanced ML Model Tuning
- No automated hyperparameter tuning.
- Manual tuning may be required for best model performance.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Scalability Limitations
- Designed for local execution; may slow down on very large datasets.
- Real-time scoring would require deployment on scalable infrastructure.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Lack of Full Time-Series Modeling
- Currently models churn as a static prediction.
- Does not yet include survival analysis or time-dependent churn forecasting.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Limited Production Deployment Support
- Local-only tool; cloud deployment requires additional configuration.
- Not yet designed for multi-user enterprise dashboards.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ No Real-time API Integration
- Not integrated with real-time CRM or customer service systems.

## üîÆ Possible Future Enhancements

- Full Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) projections.
- Real-time churn prediction API services.
- Cloud deployment (AWS/GCP/Azure with Docker support).
- Deep learning models for behavioral churn analysis.
- Automated hyperparameter tuning (AutoML integration).
- Multi-scenario campaign optimization engine.
- Integration with CRM systems (Salesforce, Hubspot, etc.).
- Full role-based multi-user dashboards.
- Interactive data exploration and dynamic segment filtering.
